 # Social Network API Routes ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

  ## About/Description

  This project was to use Mongoose and MongoDB to create API routes for a social network. The routes all for the creation, deletion, changes to, and get one or all of users. This is done using CRUD routes.  Users can add friends which is a self reference to other userIDs.  Users can also create, delete, modify thoughts.  These thoughts can also be pulled by either all of one by an id.  Lastly, users can react to the thoughts and delete these reactions.  Mongoose allows reactions to be a subdocument of main thought document.  This project has no front end so everything is done with Insomnia or Postman to test.
